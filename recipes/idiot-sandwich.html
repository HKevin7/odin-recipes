        <!-- The final paragraph describes the necessary steps to complete the recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In order to create this Gordon Ramsey inspired dish,
                you will need a friend or family member that is preparing 
                a meal as we speak
            </li>
            <li>Have 2 slices of bread ready in both of your hands</li>
            <li>Pay close attention to the person preparing the meal, and 
                lookout for mistakes they might make
            </li>
            <li>As soon as you notice the slightest hint of a mistake, make sure 
                you have the person's attention and <strong>firmly</strong> place one of both sandwich slices
                on each of the person's cheeks
            </li>
            <li>This next step is very important. When having the person's head 
                between the sandwich slices, 
                make sure they understand the situation they are in by asking them
                '<strong>WHAT ARE YOU?!</strong>'. If they haven't lived under a rock for the past 
                decade, they should understand the message
            </li>
            <li>Did the person admit that they are an idiot sandwich? Great! You
                succesfully created an idiot sandwich and in addition saved yourself
                of what could have been a disastrous meal!
            </li>
        </ol>
