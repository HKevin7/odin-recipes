        <!-- The final paragraph describes the necessary steps to complete the recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the apple and clean the damn apple. 
                Who doesn't clean their apple before eating it.
                Get serious.</li>
            <li>Get yourself a big pineapple and a knife, preferably 
                a sharp one, and start peeling the pineapple 
                (<em>please do be carefull, I'm not trying to get sued</em>)
            </li>
            <li>Once you're done with cleaning your apple and peeling 
                your pineapple, take a pen of your own preferance, and just 
                go ahead and stick the pen in the apple (<em>or pineapple first, if
                you're into that</em>)
            </li>
            <li>Now you should have an apple on stick (<em>on a pen actually
                but you get the point</em>), and what you want to do now is 
                just take the other side of your pen and get your other fruit 
                (<em>depending on which one you used first</em>) stuck on that
                pen.
            </li>
            <li>If you've completed these quick but crucial steps
                in the right order, you should have something what 
                kinda looks like a gym barbell made out of fruit. Is that
                the case? Great! You've just made yourself a fresh 
                <strong>pen pineapple apple pen</strong>!
            </li>
